-Levels:  
 As you can see there is 8 files named "level#number.txt"  
 You can change them if you want.  
 But there is some important rules :  
  -All line begin with a "/"  
   no "/" in the file mean no level and the game end.
   A wall is a "1"  
   The hero is a "3"  
   An ennemy is a "7"  
   The ROOM_WIDTH  is 135  
   The ROOM_HEIGHT is 90  
   if there is no wall you will end up to lose because you will fall after the bottom
   If there is no ennemy the level is won.  
   If you don't put a hero the hero is automatically placed at the middle  
   Dont fall under the bottom line or you die (this mean disappear from the bottom of the screen)
